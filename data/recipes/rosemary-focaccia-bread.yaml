title: Rosemary Focaccia Bread
description: This is my all-time favorite bread to make at home. It ends up sweet, moist, and you don't even need butter on it. I like to top it with cheddar or jack cheese to make it even better.

  - bread
ingredients:
  - 1 1/3 cups Water (warm)
  - 2 tsp Honey
  - 1 package (7g) Yeast
  - 3 1/2 cups Flour (all-purpose)
  - 1/4 cup Olive Oil
  - 2 tsp Salt
  - 2 sprigs Rosemary
  - 1 1/2 cups Shredded Cheddar Cheese
method:
  - Proof the yeast. Mix the warm water (not too hot) with the honey, and add the yeast. Stir gently and wait until the yeast starts to foam (about 5 minutes).
  - Add in the flour and olive oil and begin mixing. Add the salt as well and begin forming a dough.
  - Dump the dough out onto a floured surface and knead it for 5 minutes until you get a nice sticky dough. Add a pinch of water as needed.
  - Coat a large bowl with a little olive oil, add the dough, cover with plastic wrap, and let the dough rise for about an hour or until at least doubled in size.
  - Remove the dough from the bowl and flatten it out. Shape it into a circle (for a cast iron pan), or a rectangle (for a baking sheet), and place it in your greased pan. Using your fingers, poke deep dents all over the dough surface
  - Drizzle the top of the dough with olive oil, and sprinkle some more salt and the rosemary on top. Then preheat your oven to 400 degrees F while letting the dough rise for another 20 minutes.
  - "Bake for 20 minutes, until slightly golden and/or the cheese is crispy on top. Serve end enjoy!"
  - "(Optional): Before baking, add 1-1 1/2 cups of shredded cheese of choice to the top of the loaf."
