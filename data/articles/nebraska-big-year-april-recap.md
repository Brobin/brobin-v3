April was one of the biggest month of the year, both in birds added to the list, and in miles traveled. Searching for birds this month took me literally to all 4 corners of the state. Once again, it had some great chases, some disappointing misses, and of course, some really good birds along the way.

The month started out kinda slow, but the shorebirding started to pick up my mid April, along with an influx of sparrows. I ticked off **Vesper** (166), **Lincoln's** (167), **Chipping** (168), **Swamp** (169), **Eastern Towhee** (173), and **Grasshopper Sparrows** (175) quite early in the month. No luck yet with a spring LeConte's or Henslow's but attempts will be made later for those. I also got nearly all my shorebird targets, still just looking for Sanderling, Western Sandpiper, and Ruddy Turnstone.

### Partridge

The 2 big targets for this month were 2 life birds, Glossy Ibis, and Gray Partridge. On April 11th, Keegan and I took off for Cedar county to try for partridge. After camping the night, we arrived at a traditional partridge spot just before sunrise. I was rolling the window down and noticed 2 game birds pop out of the ditch into the corn stubble. I immediately clocked them as **Gray Partridge** (179) just before they flew off. Unfortunately due to the viewing angle from the passenger seat, Keegan didn't get a look. I'm sure we'll be back up there someday to try again.

Also on that trip we stopped at Lake North/Babcock. There were literally hundreds of shorebirds, perhaps thousands. The only year bird we could pick out of the bunch were **American Golden-Plover** (178). Later in the month, I visited Lake North again to see the **Snowy Plover** (208) that Lynette found! A great bird, and one I wasn't expecting to see 2 years in a row.

### Lange WPA

The next lifer target was Glossy Ibis. Paul Dunbar graciously scouted out some locations in Clay county, and the next weekend, we headed out, starting at Lange WPA. It was a gorgeous crisp spring morning day and the small pond at Lange WPA was loaded with shorebirds. There weren't any Ibis visible, but we decided to take a short hike through the meadow to get a better look. Just after we had begun scoping the shorebirds, 3 huge white birds flew in nearly straight at us, a family group of Whooping Cranes! They landed less than 50 feet away from us, completely unbothered by our presence, before moseying along through the meadow to the north. It was an incredible experience with these amazing birds that I don't think will be matched for a long time.

After Lange, we hit a few other spots, until we ended up at Kissinger Basin. After a bit of a hike out to the mudflats, we began scanning through a group of about 30 ibis. And sure enough, with a little effort, we were able to find a **Glossy Ibis** (199)! A lifer for both Keegan and I.

It seems our Whooping Crane discovery earlier at Lange WPA set off a sort of [Patagonia picnic table effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patagonia_picnic_table_effect). The next day when Dave C headed out there to look for the cranes, he found a **Whimbrel** (205)! Of course, I had to go see that one, so I made another visit for Clay county. And the day after _that_, Joel headed out here and found a White-tailed Kite! I spent some time looking for that one too and was unable to relocate it, but it was still really cool to see a small wetland get such great birds.

### Out West

With most of the eastern targets out of the way before migration truly begins, I decided to take a long weekend out west to see some of the western and shortgrass prairie specialties. A stop at Lake McConaughy yielded **Caspian Tern** (221) and **Clark's Grebe** (222). The weather didn't cooperate with us much for a visit to Crescent Lake, and the shorebirds were quite lacking, but we still found **Burrowing Owl** (224) and **Say's Phoebe** (225).

After that we headed further west to find a **Mountain Plover** (228) in Kimball county, as well as **Thick-billed Longspur** (227) and **Chestnut-collared Longspur**. A jaunt up to Sowbelly canyon gave us an incredible **Black-bellied Plover** (230) flyover of all things, and the first **Violet-green Swallows** (229) of the year. We also saw the rare **Common Raven** on Henry road, and got much better looks than I had in February.

Having gotten most of the western targets by Sunday, we decided to drive back and try for a Western Sandpiper in Hastings, and a White-eyed Vireo the next day at Fontenelle forst. Unfortuantely both birds didn't show.

### Migration!

After the trip west, I spent Monday in Sarpy county and racked up another 11 year birds, including a returning **Prothonotary Warbler** (238). A few more birds back in Lancaster, and now I'm ready to chase all the migrants!

### An attempt was made

There were a few birds that I attempted to find, but did not this month (most were expected misses, but I had to try). Yellow Rail at Jack Sinn WMA, Fish Crow in Richardson county, White-tailed Kite in Clay county, White-eyed Vireo at Fontenelle Forest, and Western Sandpiper in Hastings were a few of the (longshot) misses this month.
