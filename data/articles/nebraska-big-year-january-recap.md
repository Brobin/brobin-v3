As some of you may know, I'm giving a Nebraska state Big Year a crack this year. What does this mean you ask? It means I'm committing to driving thousands of miles, spending hundreds of hours, doing my absolute best to see as many species of birds in the state of Nebraska in one calendar year. It will be a long and tiring year, punctuated by exciting chases and bitter disappointements, but I am committed and ready to give it all I have. The current Big Year record is 347, set in 2013 by Paul Dunbar. This record is incredible, absolutely blowing the previous record of 331 out of the water. Nebraska on average gets about 370 species of birds either breeding or passing through each year, and in 2025 I'm setting out with a goal to see 350 of them. I'll be blogging as best I can on here, and at least doing monthly updates.

### January 1

It was a cold winter morning in North Platte, and I woke up early at 5am to get my first bird of the year. I hopped in the car, and drove from my hotel to some canyons 30 miles to the southeast. Shortly after arriving at the spot (which I had scoped out on Dec 31st), I heard my target bird, a **Northern Saw-whet Owl**! Right after hearing it, it buzzed right over my head, and I got just a glimpse of it as it passed through my car headlights and deep into the woods. A pretty good bird to start off the year!

From there, I hit the road, aiming to be at Lake Ogallala by sunrise where a buffet of waterfowl was awaiting me. Shortly after arriving I found 4 of my key targets, all continuing birds: **Long-tailed Duck**, **White-winged Scoter**, **Black Scoter**, and **Surf Scoter**. All 4 of those birds are huge to get so early in the year, especially all at the same location, and will save me hours and hours of searching in the fall. After that, I settled in to find the big target. Boni and Colleen arrived shortly after and we began scoping. The rafts of waterfowl were huge, at least a few thousand, but after 15 minutes or so, we got onto it, my first lifer of the year: **Eurasian Wigeon**!

Crazy enough as it seems, from there I headed BACK to North Platte for 2 more rarities because Big Years are all about getting the rarest birds first. The bird I had just gotten as a lifer a few weeks prior showed off it's brilliant yellow to me again in the new year: **Couch's Kingbird**, a continuing first state record! HUGE thanks to the Nelsons for being such gracious hosts. One last big target was waiting for me at the North Platte WTP, and moments after spotting the **Barrow's Goldeneye**, I headed west.

I finished January 1st with 78 species, and 8 rare targets, and 1 lifer! I was off to the races.

### January 2

I woke up again before dawn to drive from Gering to Harrison to participate in a Christmas Bird Count. I was in charge of Pants Butte and Sowbelly Roads, 2 excellent birding areas. Early in the morning, at the intersection of Pants Butte and Sowbelly, I had my 2nd life bird of the year: **Gray-crowned Rosy-Finch**! GCRF was one of my main targets, and I got pretty good views of a relatively large flock before they disappeared into the hills.

A few more excellent pickups for the day were **Common Raven**, **Sharp-tailed Grouse**, **Black-billed Magpie**, and **Golden Eagle**, all western specialties that I was very pleased to get so early. After meeting up around lunch to tally our CBC results, I took the scenic route down Henry Road, checking again for rosy-finches, but not coming up with much except **Rough-legged Hawks**.

### January 3

This was the day I planned to see Pinyon Jays, but it didn't start out as planned. A thin blanket of snow covered the ground in Gering as I set out for the day, but after a couple hundred yards of driving, I realized I had a flat tire (probably from driving 40 miles of gravelt the day before). I attempted to put the spare on, but my tiny wimpy car jack wouldn't do. Thanks to the Gering police department I was finally able to get the spare on and hit the road again. (Yes, I did buy a new jack immediately after getting home)

60 miles later on a spare tire, I pulled up to the traditional Pinyon Jay feeders, and for nearly 90 minutes all I saw were the usual species. I was beginning to lose hope, when finally I noticed the undulating flight pattern of a group of birds coming in from the west. After inspecting the feeders for a minute or so, my year's first **Pinyon Jays** overwhelmed the feeders! 3 days in and 3 life birds.

I spent the next 2 hours killing time in a coffee shop while my tire was repaired in Bridgeport. Not the best way to spend prime birding time during a time-crunched Big Year, but I had already driven 30 miles more than I should have on the spare.

I was able to salvage the rest of the day at Lake Minitaire, Buffalo Creek WMA and Wildcat Hills, notching another 3 western specialty year birds: **Rock Wren** (early or overwintering), **Townsend's Solitaire**, and **Pygmy Nuthatch**.

### January 4

Like the evening before, I camped out at the feeders at Wildcat Hills, hoping to glimpse a Cassin's Finch. After 90 minutes, and with the weather projected to get worse, I decided to call it and begin the long drive home.

I stopped off in Kearney to look for the Brant that was seen a few days before, but had no luck. I continued home in the freezing rain with a repsectable 93 species in 4 days.

### January 5-31

The rest of the month I spent in the east, knocking out a few more key targets. **Snow Bunting** in Platte, **Tundra Swan** in Douglas, and **Purple Finch** and **Hermit Thrush** in Lancaster were the most notable birds.
