As I expected, July was a difficult month for the big year. Motivation to get out and bird was a bit low, but I still got out and about searching for the slim chance of a rarity in a few different places throughout the state.

### Florida!

July started off slow, because I took a break from Nebraska birding! I took a short trip to Florida over the 4th of July weekend and had a great time. I wasn't primarily birding, but I was able to find a day to dedicate wholly to birding (along with a little on the side), and came away with 8 life birds. You can see [my trip report on ebird](https://ebird.org/tripreport/391872) for more. Highlights of that trip were Red-cockaded Woodpecker and Bachman's Sparrow, 2 southern US endemics.

### Back to Nebraska

Back in Nebraska, the search began for the rare wandering waders and water birds. A few birds I had in mind going into the month were Yellow-crowned Night Heron, White Ibis, Common Gallinule, and a couple more even rarer birds.

Early in the month, I took a day trip to Columbus to do some Platte County birding. The main goal was to get to 125 species in Platte County, and check a few spots for anything rare, Lake North always seems to turn up something. Nothing rare made an appearance, but I did just barely get to 125 for the county, with a surprisingly difficult-to-find Eastern Meadowlark.

Other excursions included a trip to Clay county, where unfortuantely 6 of the 8 locations visited were mostly dry. We had the best luck at Smith Lagoon where a high count of 11 Great Blue Herons, and over 100 Lesser Yellowlegs were the highlights.

Besides that, I spent most of my time birding in my home county of Lancaster, checking a few different spots that still had water, most notably Jack Sinn WMA. The best bird of a few trips there was a Western Sandpiper (county #266)! This one was fun to find, since Keegan was able to get down and see it to add it to his Big Year list, as well as many other birds in the next couple days. At one point, as many as 5 Western Sandpipers were found at the location!

### Through the Grapevine

One of the most crucial parts of a Big Year is always having ears to the ground for any rarities that are showing up. I am constantly checking ebird alerts (Nebraska and neighboring states), Facebook, NEbirds emails, Discord, and keeping in touch with multiple people so I'm in the know about anything that shows up.

The first of these this month was a report of a Yellow-crowned Night Heron that Eugene received. He posted some cell phone pics that were sent to him on Discord and I had to go investigate. Sure enough, the bird was still there at the Fremont Golf Course, and I was able to tick off #329, one of the most expected wandering waders.

The second of these was a report of a Rufous Hummingbird posted on Facebook. With the help of other local birders, I was able to find the general area of the report and get a quick look at year #330 in a neighborhood in North Platte on my way out west for the weekend!

### Misses

The only notable miss for the month is Laughing Gull. There was one report by TJ Walker at Calamus Reservoir that I simply couldn't chase in the middle of the week. I hope another one shows up a little closer to home in August!

Thanks this month to Eugene, Keegan, Boni, Paul, Dan, and everyone else that's cheering me on!
