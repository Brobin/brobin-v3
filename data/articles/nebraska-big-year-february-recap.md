Overall February was a bit of a slower month, but I still ran into some great birds!

In early February I headed to Lake Ogallala specifically targeting Gulls. I spent the first night of the trip camping in North Platte, where Boni gave me some tips that led to a few years birds including **Short-eared Owl**. At Lake O, the trip continued to produce, netting me 11 year birds, including 2 very good gull targets: **Glaucous Gull** and **Short-billed Gull**. The biggest target I had that I _missed_ was Great Black-backed Gull, but I'll have another shot at that one this fall.

Back home in Lancaster County, I tried a few different places for **Long-eared Owl** and finally tracked down my first (and only) lifer of February.

Perhaps more importantly for the overall effort, February was a HUGE planning month. I refined my spreadsheet and spent hours and hours studying [Bird of Nebraska Online](https://birds.outdoornebraska.gov/) and ebird data, noting the rarity, locations, and estimated arrival dates of all the spring migrants in my big year spreadsheet.
